# PWA Icon Setup Instructions

## Required Icons for Your Mada Dashboard PWA

You need to create the following PNG files from your professional icon image:

### Required Files:
1. `icon-72x72.png` - 72x72 pixels
2. `icon-144x144.png` - 144x144 pixels  
3. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels (Android home screen)
4. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels (Android splash screen)
5. `apple-icon-180x180.png` - 180x180 pixels (iOS home screen)
6. `favicon.ico` - 32x32 pixels (browser tab)

### How to Create These Icons:

#### Option 1: Online PWA Icon Generator (Recommended)
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your icon image
3. Download all generated sizes
4. Place them in the `/public/` folder

#### Option 2: Manual Creation
